# Direct Mapped Cache

It is a designed implementation of Direct Mapped Cache in Verilog.  
The cache is designed to hold 256 BLocks, each containing 16 words (words = 32-bits), with 32-bit address line 

## Plot (Miss Rate vs Number of Compiler instructions)
![Plot](plot.png "Plot")

This plot is showing how miss rate for a specific compiler varies with number of instructions given it to run

![Plot2](plot2.png "Plot2")

This plot is analysis of how "miss rate" change with varying number of blocks in the cache for GCC compiler
